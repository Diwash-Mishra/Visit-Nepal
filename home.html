		<center><h2>VISIT NEPAL 2020</center></h2>
	<p> Welcome visitors to celebrate the year 2020 which is chosen as national tourism year of Nepal after the year 2011 which was the primary authority tourism year of new Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal. The government and tourism department of Nepal authoritatively reported that Nepal will take year 2020 as "Visit Nepal 2020", a year committed to tourism industry of Nepal with vision of making a reasonable brand picture of Nepal as travel and vacationer destination, backing up the tourism foundations of Nepal, enhance the growth of tourism industry, and enhance locale tourism as supportable industry. The Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation has planned the 2020 as Visit Nepal Year with the aim to increase the number of tourists to 20 Lakhs (2 Millions). Tourism vision 2020 Nepal has been set soon after the MOCTCA had planned to celebrate Visit Nepal Year in 2018 which was put off due to the delay in construction of airports (Pokhara and Lumbini), re-construction of heritage sites and roads. So, Visit Nepal 2020 will be the best time to celebrate the tourism vision year as the reconstruction of the heritage sites is expected to be completed before 2020.
The Earthquake 2015 hit Nepal badly resulting in death of 23000 people and thousands of victim and homeless. After the Earthquake, the flock of tourists in Nepal decreased. Now, the tourism of Nepal has taken its path to grow and Nepal is receiving good number of tourists in the year 2017 and 2018. The announcement of the Visit Nepal 2020 will give a positive message to the world and the campaign will attract more tourists to Nepal.  <br><br>
